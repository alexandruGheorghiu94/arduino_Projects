Anduino
========

This application allows the users of Android devices to learn about the Arduino ecosystem and how to use the core functions of the board: the use of analog & digital signals and also implementation of the most known example used on the Arduino board (Blink of an LED and the fade in & out of an LED).

##Hooking Everything Up
In order for this program to work you need the following things:
* [Arduino Uno R3](https://www.adafruit.com/products/50) + the usb cable to load the program onto the board
* [Bluefruit LE - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 4.0) - nRF8001 Breakout - v1.0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1697)
* [LED](https://www.adafruit.com/products/387)

For more details on how to hook up the bluetooth board to the Arduino check [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-the-nrf8001-bluefruit-le-breakout/hooking-everything-up). The LED must be connected to pin no. 6 (long leg of the LED to pin 6 and the short one to ground).

After doing all that load the program on the board and launch the Anduino Android app, more details regarding the Android app can be found in my android_Projects repository.
